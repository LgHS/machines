## Marlin

For Marlin configuration, just put the whole folder here. All files will be automatically ignored except for `Configuration.h` and `Configuration_adv.h` (advanced configuration).

For example, if you want to upload Mingda Firmware to a Megatronics controller :
* Download Marlin firmware here : https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases
* Unzip and put files from `Marlin/` folder into `3d-printers/mingda/marlin/` WITHOUT ERASING PRESENT FILES
* Upload using Arduino software.
